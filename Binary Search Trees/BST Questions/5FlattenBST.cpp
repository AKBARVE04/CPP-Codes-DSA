//FLATTEN BST TO A SORTED LINKED LIST

/*
You have been given a Binary Search Tree (BST). Your task is to
flatten the given BST to a sorted list. More formally, you have to
make a right-skewed BST from the given BST, i.e., the left child of
all the nodes must be NULL, and the value at the right child must
be greater than the current node.
