// CONVERT BST TO MIN HEAP

//Given a binary search tree which is also a complete binary tree. The problem is to convert the given BST into a Min Heap with the condition that all the values in the left subtree of a node should be less than all the values in the right subtree of the node. This condition is applied to all the nodes, in the resultant converted Min Heap.
