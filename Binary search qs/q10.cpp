/*
A new racing track for kids is being built in New York with 'n' starting spots. The spots are located along a straight line at positions xl, x2... xn (xi <= 10^9) For each 'i', +1> xi.
At a time only 'm' children are allowed to enter the race. Since the race track is for kids, they may run into each other while running. To prevent this, we want to choose the starting spots such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?
*/

/*
least distance is 1 and max dist can be the last starting point. now we find mid and now we will try to maintain atleast mid dist btwn adjacent students
